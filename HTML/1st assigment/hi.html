        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
        domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the
        modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.\ Dogs were the first
        species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago
        before the development of agriculture. Higher classification: Wolf
        Lifespan: 10 â€“ 13 years Scientific name: Canis lupus familiaris Family:
