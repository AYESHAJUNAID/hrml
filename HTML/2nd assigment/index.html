    <p> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk, lying between the copies of<em> Nature,New Scientist, </em> and all the other
     <br />
     scientific joumals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em> On The Road. </em> It had been <strong> M</strong>olly's favourite book since college,
and the longer she
       <br />
       spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
      <p> she had spent the last ten Years in this room, sitting under a poster with an <strong> O</strong>scar <strong> W</strong>ilde quote proclaiming that
     <q> <strong>W</strong>ork is the refuge of people who have
     <br />
     nothing better to do</q>.Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <strong>DNA</strong>, to be an outstanding achievement,
      <strong>M</strong>olly
     <br/>
    <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
